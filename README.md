# Library App 📚

Welcome to the Library App Project! 📖💻

This project is a simple browser-based library system that allows users to manage their books by adding, removing, and toggling the read status of each book. It was developed to practice key concepts in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

------------------------------------------

🛠️ **Project Overview**

The Library App provides a digital catalog where users can add new books, view existing ones, and interact with each book’s details. Key features include a form for adding books, dynamic book display, and functionality to remove or mark books as read.

- Books are stored in an array and each book has a unique ID.
- Books are displayed using dynamic DOM manipulation.
- Users can interact with each book via buttons to remove it or toggle its read status.

  ------------------------------------------

🎯 **Features**

📚 **Add New Book**: Use a form to input the title, author, pages, and read status of a book and add it to the library.

📖 **Display Books**: Books are displayed on the page in a grid or card format.

❌ **Remove Book**: Each book has a button to remove it from the library.

✔️ **Toggle Read Status**: Toggle a book's "read" status with the click of a button.

------------------------------------------

🧩 **Technologies Used**

- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **HTML5**: Structuring the library and layout.
- **CSS3**: Styling the library for a clean, responsive interface.

------------------------------------------

🧠 **Skills Practiced**

- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically creating, removing, and updating elements.
- **JavaScript Event Handling**: Managing user interactions like button clicks and form submissions.
- **Array Management**: Storing and managing book objects with unique identifiers.
- **Form Handling**: Using `event.preventDefault()` to control form behavior and prevent default form submission.
